Intelligent Campus Monitoring And Tracking System

Aim of project : To detect students entering or exiting the campus without proper authorization using a camera at the college gate. The system verifies their presence against a dataset. If an unauthorized student is detected, an alert is generated and sent to the HOD dashboard on the website. If a student is authorized, faculty can update the status in the Faculty Dashboard to prevent alerts.

Technology used: The project utilizes Python, OpenCV for real-time video capturing, MTCNN for face detection, DeepFace with ArcFace for face recognition, MySQL for database management, Tkinter for GUI elements, NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for similarity calculations, and HTML for website development.
